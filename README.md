# Welcome to PM Cinch

### This project will continue to evolve. As of today's date, January 29th, 2023, I am releasing version 1.0.0 of this project.

### Future versions will be coming quick.

Currently, this project consist of 6 companies, but not all companies have
entered employees or projects. Below are the login credentials for 7 employees
spanning 4 different companies.

If you work for a company, you can see all projects associated with that
company. I built it this way because I need it to work this way in real life,
and I plan on using this when I bring it further along.
